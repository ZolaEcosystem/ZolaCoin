**Innovation with Binance Smart Chain and BEP-20 Technology

Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and its token standard, BEP-20, are driving innovation in the blockchain space. 
BEP-20 enables the creation of tokens with advanced features, going beyond traditional currencies. This 
flexibility allows for the development of utility tokens, governance tokens, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), 
among others, fostering complex decentralized systems and community-driven platforms.

Enhanced by BSC's dual-chain architecture, BEP-20 tokens benefit from the scalability and low transaction 
costs. The ecosystem surrounding BSC attracts developers, projects, and investors, offering support, 
resources, and liquidity. This is precisely why the Zola team decided to launch the ZOLA token under Binance 
Smart Chain - to take advantage of the innovative features, scalability, and community support provided by 
BEP-20 and BSC.
