# ZolaCoin
Zola is an innovative cryptocurrency that is designed to provide decentralized flexible auto-staking rewards to its holders. Unlike other cryptocurrencies that require users to manually stake their tokens in order to earn rewards, Zola allows users to earn rewards in the same token automatically and without any additional action or third-party involvement. This makes it easy for anyone to hold and earn rewards with the token, regardless of their technical expertise.
